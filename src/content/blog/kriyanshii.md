description: welcome to my portfolio
---

Hey, I'm Kriyanshiâ€”welcome to my portfolio! This version is heavily inspired by [shin](https://shinbehavior.com/). and I've kept it simple yet expressive, reflecting the journey I'm on.

By day, I'm a software engineer, and in my free time, I occasionally play the flute. What started as a love for experimenting with CSS turned into writing powerful Bash scriptsâ€”some of which have accidentally wiped my hard drive (but I've definitely improved since then! ðŸ˜†).

Lately, I've been working on backend systems, distributed computing, and DAG-based scheduling in Go. Here, I'll be sharing insights from my projects, things Iâ€™m learning, and maybe even a few unexpected detoursâ€”whether it's tech, music, or something fun. 

Glad youâ€™re here, and I hope you find something interesting. Thanks for stopping by! ðŸš€
