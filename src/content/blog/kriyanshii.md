## 🌿 About Me

I work at the **Space Applications Center, ISRO**,  
where I contribute to a **Golang-based scheduler** —  
a system with a clean web interface and orchestration logic,  
built as an *alternative to Airflow*.

Alongside this, I work on **interactive computing environments** —  
systems that let researchers explore data, run experiments,  
and turn complex analyses into shareable, reproducible notebooks.

My focus is on **bridging infrastructure and experience** —  
making computation feel *alive*, *collaborative*, and *approachable*.

Beyond code, I’m drawn to slower, grounding things:

- 🎶 Playing the flute  
- 🌳 Identifying and planting trees  
- 🍰 Baking cupcakes and cakes on weekends  
- 📚 Reading essays and quiet books

*I like building things that feel thoughtful and precise —*  
*systems that do their job, beautifully.*

**→ Let’s build something lasting.**
