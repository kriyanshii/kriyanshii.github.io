---

hey, this is kriyanshi, and welcome to my portfolio. i am a software engineer who loves writing efficient code. this version of my portfolio is  heavily inspired by [shin](https://shinbehavior.com/). I have been working as software engineer and ocassionaly i play flute in my free time. I converted my hobby of  creating random things with css into writing strong bash scripts that sometimes wipe out my hard drive but i have improved my bash skill(lol).
