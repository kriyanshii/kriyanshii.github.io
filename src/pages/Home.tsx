					I‚Äôm a software engineer at ISRO‚Äôs Space Applications Centre, where I get to play with satellites (well, their data at least üöÄ). I‚Äôve built tools that ingest and schedule data from geostationary satellites and crafted interactive environments with JupyterHub to make planetary and weather research a lot more hands-on.

Right now, I‚Äôm diving into SeaDAS, NASA‚Äôs go-to toolkit for processing and analyzing Earth observation data ‚Äî tweaking it, customizing it, and making sure scientists can get the most out of satellite snapshots of our planet üåç‚ú®.					</p>
